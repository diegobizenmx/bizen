# 🍎 Xcode Quick Guide - Finding the Device Selector

## Where to Find the Device Selector

The device selector is in the **top toolbar** of Xcode, right next to the Play button.

### If You Don't See It:

1. **Make sure the toolbar is visible:**
   - Go to: **View → Show Toolbar** (or press `Cmd + Option + T`)
   - The toolbar should appear at the top

2. **Look for this in the toolbar:**
   ```
   [▶️ Play]  [⏹ Stop]  [App ▼]  [iPhone 15 ▼]
                              ↑           ↑
                         Scheme      Device Selector
   ```

3. **The device selector looks like:**
   - Shows "iPhone 15" or "App" or similar
   - Has a dropdown arrow (▼)
   - Click it to see available simulators

### Alternative: Use the Menu

If you still can't find it:
1. Click **Product** in the menu bar
2. Go to **Destination**
3. You'll see available simulators there
4. Select one (e.g., "iPhone 15")

### If No Simulators Appear:

1. Go to: **Xcode → Settings** (or **Preferences**)
2. Click **Platforms** tab
3. You'll see iOS simulators listed
4. If none are installed, click the **+** button to download one
5. Download "iOS 17.0" or latest (this takes a few minutes)
