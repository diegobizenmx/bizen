# 📱 Mobile App - Next Steps

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Capacitor installed and configured
- ✅ Android project created (`android/` folder)
- ✅ iOS project created (`ios/` folder)
- ✅ Configuration points to `https://bizen.mx`
- ✅ All your code is safe (no changes made)

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Option 1: iOS Development (Recommended for macOS)

**Step 1: Install Xcode**
1. Open App Store on your Mac
2. Search for "Xcode"
3. Click "Get" or "Install" (free, ~12GB download)
4. Wait for installation (30-60 minutes)

**Step 2: Open Xcode Once**
1. Open Xcode from Applications
2. Accept the license agreement
3. Let it install additional components (5-10 minutes)

**Step 3: Test Your App**
```bash
# Sync configuration
npx cap sync

# Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select a simulator (iPhone 15, etc.)
# 2. Click Run (▶️) or press Cmd + R
# 3. Your app will load from https://bizen.mx
```

### Option 2: Android Development

**Step 1: Install Android Studio**
1. Go to: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Download for Mac
3. Install (~1GB download)
4. Open Android Studio
5. Complete setup wizard (installs Android SDK)

**Step 2: Test Your App**
```bash
# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
# 1. Wait for Gradle sync
# 2. Click Run (▶️) or press Shift + F10
# 3. Select an emulator or device
# 4. Your app will load from https://bizen.mx
```

## 🚀 Quick Test (Without Installing Tools)

You can verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# Check Android project
ls android/app/src/main/

# Check iOS project  
ls ios/App/

# Check configuration
cat capacitor.config.ts
```

Both projects should exist and be configured correctly.

## 📝 Important Notes

### How It Works
- Your mobile app loads your web app from `https://bizen.mx`
- All your API routes work exactly as they do on web
- No code changes needed
- Updates to your web app automatically appear in mobile (after app restart)

### For Development
If you want to test with your local server, update `capacitor.config.ts`:

```typescript
server: {
  url: 'http://localhost:3004',  // Your local dev server
  cleartext: true
}
```

Then run `npx cap sync` to apply changes.

### For Production
Keep the production URL:
```typescript
server: {
  url: 'https://bizen.mx',
  cleartext: false
}
```

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Once you install Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android), you can:
1. Test your app in simulators
2. Build for real devices
3. Submit to App Store / Play Store

**Your mobile app setup is complete!** 🚀

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need both Xcode and Android Studio?**  
A: No! You can develop for one platform at a time. Start with iOS since you're on Mac.

**Q: Can I test without a real device?**  
A: Yes! Both Xcode and Android Studio include simulators/emulators.

**Q: Will my web app still work?**  
A: Yes! Your web app is completely separate and unaffected.

**Q: How do I update the mobile app?**  
A: Just deploy updates to your web app. Mobile users will see updates when they restart the app.
