# 🎯 What To Do Next - Cleanup Guide

## Current Situation

You have **BIZEN** (your project) which was copied from **Microcredential** (the original project). There are leftover files from Microcredential that you don't need.

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Identify What BIZEN Actually Uses (10 minutes)

**Answer these questions:**

1. **Does BIZEN have a module/lesson system?**
   - If NO → Remove `src/app/module/`, `src/app/modules/`, `src/module/`
   - If YES → Keep them

2. **Does BIZEN use root `/login` and `/signup`?**
   - If NO (uses `/bizen/login` instead) → Remove `src/app/login/`, `src/app/signup/`
   - If YES → Keep them

3. **Does BIZEN track student progress through modules?**
   - If NO → Remove `src/app/api/progress/`, `src/app/api/sections/`
   - If YES → Keep them

4. **Does BIZEN have quizzes/tests?**
   - If NO → Remove `src/app/api/quizzes/`, `src/app/quiz/`
   - If YES → Keep them

5. **Does BIZEN use the teacher/admin system?**
   - If NO → Remove `src/app/teacher/`, `src/app/admin/`
   - If YES → Keep them

### Step 2: Find Microcredential Files (5 minutes)

**Run the script I created:**

```bash
bash find-microcredential-files.sh
```

This will show you:
- Files mentioning "microcredential"
- Files mentioning "mondragon"
- Files mentioning "BSMX"
- Module routes
- Auth routes

**Or manually search:**

```bash
# Find microcredential references
grep -r "microcredential" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Find module routes
ls -la src/app/module*
ls -la src/module*
```

---

### Step 3: Review the Cleanup Plan (5 minutes)

**Read:** `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`

This document lists:
- ✅ Files to remove
- ✅ Files to keep
- ✅ Safe removal order
- ✅ What to check before removing

---

### Step 4: Create a Backup (2 minutes)

**Before removing anything:**

```bash
# Create a backup branch
git checkout -b backup-before-cleanup
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before removing Microcredential files"
git checkout main  # or your main branch
```

**Or just commit current state:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Before cleanup - current state"
```

---

### Step 5: Start Removing (One Category at a Time)

**Start with the safest removals first:**

#### Phase 1: Remove Module Routes (If Not Used)

```bash
# If BIZEN doesn't use modules:
rm -rf src/app/module/
rm -rf src/app/modules/
rm -rf src/module/
```

**Then test:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Check if app still works
```

#### Phase 2: Remove Microcredential Auth (If BIZEN Uses /bizen/*)

```bash
# If BIZEN uses /bizen/login instead of /login:
rm -rf src/app/login/
rm -rf src/app/signup/
rm -rf src/app/auth/callback/  # If BIZEN uses /bizen/auth/callback
```

**Then test again**

#### Phase 3: Remove Microcredential Components

```bash
# Remove BSMX components (clearly Microcredential)
rm src/components/BSMX*.tsx

# Remove module-specific components (if not used)
rm src/components/ModuleGate.tsx
rm src/components/ModuleSectionsGated.tsx
# etc.
```

#### Phase 4: Remove Microcredential API Routes

```bash
# If BIZEN doesn't track module progress:
rm -rf src/app/api/modules/
rm -rf src/app/api/progress/  # If Microcredential-specific
rm -rf src/app/api/sections/
```

---

### Step 6: Clean Up Code References

**After removing files, clean up imports:**

1. **Search for broken imports:**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # This will show import errors
   ```

2. **Remove Microcredential references:**
   - Search for "microcredential" in code
   - Search for "mondragon" in code
   - Update or remove those references

3. **Update middleware:**
   - Remove Microcredential route checks if not needed
   - Keep only BIZEN routes

---

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

**If you're not sure about a file:**

1. **Check if it's imported:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "filename" src/app/bizen/
   grep -r "filename" src/components/
   ```

2. **Check if BIZEN uses the feature:**
   - Does BIZEN have modules? → Keep module files
   - Does BIZEN have quizzes? → Keep quiz files
   - Does BIZEN have student progress? → Keep progress files

3. **When in doubt, keep it:**
   - You can always remove later
   - Better to have extra files than break the app

---

## 📋 Recommended Order

**Do this in order:**

1. ✅ **Test current app** - Make sure it works
2. ✅ **Create backup** - Git commit or branch
3. ✅ **Run find script** - See what files exist
4. ✅ **Read cleanup plan** - Understand what to remove
5. ✅ **Remove one category** - Start with modules
6. ✅ **Test after removal** - Make sure nothing broke
7. ✅ **Continue gradually** - One category at a time
8. ✅ **Clean up code** - Remove references in code

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't remove everything at once** - Test after each removal
2. **Keep BIZEN-specific features** - Business Lab, Cash Flow, Simulators, Forum
3. **If unsure, ask** - Better to be safe
4. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure BIZEN features still work

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

**If you want me to help identify specific files:**

1. Tell me what features BIZEN actually uses
2. I can create a custom cleanup list
3. I can help remove files safely

**Or if you want to do it yourself:**

1. Use `find-microcredential-files.sh` to find files
2. Use `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` as a guide
3. Remove one category at a time
4. Test after each removal

---

## 🎉 After Cleanup

Once you've removed Microcredential files:

1. ✅ Your codebase will be cleaner
2. ✅ Less confusion about what's BIZEN vs Microcredential
3. ✅ Easier to maintain
4. ✅ Smaller codebase

Then you can continue with:
- Migrating API routes to use new auth utilities
- Other improvements from the analysis
